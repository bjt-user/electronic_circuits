FAILS:
This does NOT work:

Error while burning bootloader!

=> choosing "ATTiny85/45 (Optiboot)" in Tools->Board instead of "ATTiny85 (micronucleus/digispark)" made the bootloading work

But programming the chip still doesnt work:

Arduino: 1.8.13 (Linux), Board: "ATtiny45/85 (Optiboot), Enabled, CPU (CPU frequency), ATtiny85, 8 MHz (internal), B.O.D. Disabled (saves power), Enabled"

Warning: platform.txt from core 'ATTinyCore' contains deprecated compiler.path={runtime.tools.avr-gcc.path}/bin/, automatically converted to compiler.path=/usr/bin/. Consider upgrading this core.
Sketch uses 456 bytes (5%) of program storage space. Maximum is 7616 bytes.
Global variables use 9 bytes (1%) of dynamic memory, leaving 503 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 512 bytes.
An error occurred while uploading the sketch
avrdude: verification error, first mismatch at byte 0x003a

avrdude: verification error; content mismatch


This report would have more information with
"Show verbose output during compilation"
option enabled in File -> Preferences.

Try different resources. (and/or program with avrdude)

It is probably better to get this:
https://www.reichelt.de/de/en/programmer-for-avr-stk500-atmega-attiny-at90-diamex-usb-isp-p110344.html?search=Diamex+USB-ISP&&r=1
and not use the Arduino setup.
Easier to connect, you don't have to mess with Arduino setup.
